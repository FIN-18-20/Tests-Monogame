______________________❄_ADVANCED_TECHNIQUES_❄_______________________

  >  Whilst colliding with a wall, keep your LEFT / RIGHT key 
     pressed and press the UP key once to do a WALLJUMP.

  >  When running off a platform, it is possible to jump whilst
     your player is in the air. This will be refered to as a 
     MID-AIR jump.


__________________________❄_WALKTHROUGH_❄___________________________

  > LVL 1
    - Blow out the first and third torch to activate all movers
    - Activate the lever next to the exit to unveil (for 10s) the hidden blocks (situated at the beggining of the level)
    - Activate the torch using a fireball at the top of the hidden blocks
    - Complete the level by entering the exit door

    Note: deactivating / activating the torches to stop the movers once they are in a favorable position may facilitate the completion of the level

  > LVL 2
    - Grab the blue key (situated in the bottom-left corner of the level)
    - Activate the lever to deactivate (for 4s) the two lasers
    - Quickly open the blue lock and pick up the red key
    - Open the bottom red lock and light the torch to activate the mover
    - Take the yellow key and open the other red lock
    - Use a mid-air jump to get back to the spawn and open the final (yellow) lock
    - Complete the level by entering the exit door

    Note: don't worry about the spikes at the bottom, they only hurt you a bit (but make sure to avoid the lasers)

  > LVL 3
    - Activate the torch to start off the level
    - For the first part, use walljumps in order to stay on the vertical mover
    - Turn on the lever to activate the second mover
    - Upon arriving to the top, use mainly mid-air jumps to keep yourself from falling down
    - Take the blue key using a mid-air jump
    - Open the blue lock and complete the level by entering the exit door
    
    (Easier Variation)
    - Start walljumping on the mover on your left and throw a fireball at the torch below you
    - Enter the hole in the ceiling and walljump all the way to the top
    - Don't forget to grab the red key on your way up
    - Open the red lock and complete the level by entering the exit door
        
    Notes: there are two checkpoints that save your progress throughout the level to help you make it to the end
           it may be helpfull to zoom out using "2" while on the second mover

  > LVL 4
    - Don't mind the door and the torch on your right, it's just a trap !
    - Instead, jump down the hole but make sure you don't touch the yellow keys (only pick up the red key)
    - Walljump your way up again and unlock the yellow locks
    - Using mid-air jumps, jump from block to block, again without touching the yellow keys
    - Once you arrive at the top-left block, do a mid-air jump to the right while ducking to pass between the two collumns of keys
    - Using walljumps and once again not collecting the yellow keys, get to the blue key and pick it up
    - Unlock the yellow lock and go ahead and jump from blue lock to blue lock
    - Complete the level by entering the exit door

    Notes: there are two checkpoints to help you make it through
           as soon as you pick up a yellow key, just press R to restart at the last checkpoint
